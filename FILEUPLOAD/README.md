# FILEUPLOAD Example

## HTMX Features Demonstrated

**Primary**: `hx-post`, `hx-encoding="multipart/form-data"`, `hx-indicator`, Drag & Drop API
**Secondary**: File validation, progress tracking, multiple file uploads, security measures

## User Story

As a user needing to upload files to a web application, I want a modern, intuitive interface that supports drag-and-drop functionality with real-time progress feedback, so that I can upload files efficiently and confidently know when uploads are complete.

## How It Works

1. **Interface Display**: User sees drag-and-drop zones with clear instructions
2. **File Selection**: User drags files or clicks to browse file system
3. **Validation Check**: Client-side validation before upload begins
4. **Upload Process**: Files sent to server with progress tracking
5. **Server Processing**: Backend validates, processes, and stores files
6. **Feedback Display**: Success/error messages with file information
7. **History Display**: List of uploaded files with management options

```

## Technical Implementation

### Flask Routes
- **`/`**: Main upload interface with drag-and-drop zones
- **`/upload`**: Single file upload with validation and storage
- **`/upload-multiple`**: Multiple file upload batch processing
- **`/validate-file`**: Pre-upload file validation
- **`/files`**: List uploaded files for management
- **`/delete-file/<filename>`**: Delete uploaded files

### File Validation Logic
- **Extension Check**: Allow only safe file types (images, documents, archives)
- **Size Limits**: 16MB maximum file size with configurable limits
- **Security Scan**: Basic security checks for suspicious content
- **Filename Sanitization**: Prevent path traversal and invalid characters
- **MIME Type Validation**: Server-side content type verification

### Upload Response Format
```json
// Success response
{
  "success": true,
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "unique_filename": "uuid-document.pdf",
  "size": 1024000,
  "type": "application/pdf",
  "message": "Successfully uploaded document.pdf"
}

// Error response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "File type .exe not allowed. Allowed types: png, jpg, pdf, ..."
}
```

### Template Architecture
```jinja2
<!-- Drag and Drop Upload Zone -->
<div class="upload-zone" id="upload-zone">
    <div class="upload-zone-content">
        <div class="upload-icon">üìÅ</div>
        <p class="upload-text">Drag and drop files here or click to browse</p>
        <input type="file" id="file-input" name="file" style="display: none;">
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Upload Progress -->
<div id="upload-indicator" class="htmx-indicator upload-progress">
