**Decision**: Dedicated upload endpoints with comprehensive validation
**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of upload logic from other application concerns
- Enables different validation rules for different upload types
- Supports both single and batch file operations
- Easy to extend with additional upload features

### File Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Temporary local storage with cleanup procedures
**Rationale**:
- Simple implementation for demonstration purposes
- Easy to replace with cloud storage in production
- Automatic cleanup prevents disk space issues
- Secure file permissions and access controls

### Response Format Design
**Decision**: Structured JSON responses with consistent error handling
**Rationale**:
- Consistent API contract for client consumption
- Clear success/failure indicators
- Detailed error messages with user guidance
- Extensible format for additional metadata

## UX Design Decisions

### Visual Feedback Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-state visual indicators with clear status communication
**Rationale**:
- Users need clear understanding of upload status
- Different states require different visual treatments
- Accessibility requires text-based status information
- Progressive enhancement supports various user needs

### Error Handling Approach
**Decision**: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
**Rationale**:
- Technical errors are not helpful to end users
- Clear instructions help users resolve issues
- Consistent error messaging across all failure modes
- Recovery options provided where possible

### File Management Interface
**Decision**: Simple list view with basic file operations
**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate feedback on uploaded files
- Basic management operations (delete) for demonstration
- Extensible design for additional file operations
- Clean, uncluttered interface focused on core functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### HTMX Attribute Configuration
```html
<form hx-post="/upload"
      hx-encoding="multipart/form-data"
      hx-target="#upload-result"
      hx-indicator="#upload-indicator">
```

**hx-post**: Standard form submission endpoint
**hx-encoding**: Required for file upload data
**hx-target**: Specific DOM update for results
**hx-indicator**: Progress indication during upload

### File Validation Pipeline
```python
def validate_file(file):
    # 1. Filename sanitization
    # 2. Extension validation
    # 3. Size limit checking
    # 4. Content type verification
    # 5. Security scanning
    # 6. Storage preparation
```

### Drag & Drop Event Handling
```javascript
uploadZone.addEventListener('dragover', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    uploadZone.classList.add('drag-over');
});

uploadZone.addEventListener('drop', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const files = e.dataTransfer.files;
    // Process dropped files
});
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Upload Efficiency
**Decision**: Streaming file handling with memory-efficient processing
**Rationale**:
- Large files don't consume excessive server memory
- Upload progress can be tracked in real-time
- Efficient handling of concurrent uploads
